# vscode-faust  

A VS Code extension for Faust that works with [faustlsp](https://github.com/carn181/faustlsp).
Currently its only purpose is to help debug faustlsp, so it is really basic.

## Usage  

Run `npm install` in this project folder, then open this extension project in VS Code and press `F5` (or Run->Start Debugging).  
This will open a new Extension Development Host VS Code window.  
Open your Faust project in this window.  
Make sure to have a `.faustcfg.json` in your Faust project workspace and install faustlsp for the LSP to run.
